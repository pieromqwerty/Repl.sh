# Replit.sh: Repl.it's Internal URL Shortener

# Note! 
This repository is way out of date. Please use [v4](https://github.com/replit-discord/Replit.sh-v4).

## Preface
If you follow [@replit](https://twitter.com/replit) on Twitter, you may have realized some links showing up on our posts starting with the url [replit.sh](https://replit.sh). Versions 3 and 4 are on hold for now due to the need for dependencies to be built up in the Replit.sh ecosystem (such as a rework of the modules). 

## Notes:
- This URL Shortener can only be run on Repl.it due to it using [Repl.it DB](https://docs.repl.it/misc/database).
- Users are managed with [Repl.it Auth](https://repl.it/talk/learn/Authenticating-users-with-Replit-Auth/23460), so keep that in mind.

		2. If you wanted to add your friend who has id `654321`, your `.env` file would look like `IDS=[123456,654321]`.
